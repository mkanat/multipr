# multipr

Do you need to make one really large change that you want to split into multiple PRs, each with different reviewers?

Do you need to make a lot of small changes to many repositories and you need some way to track all of those PRs?

Mutipr is a system for sending out many PRs to one or many repositories, managing their state, and helping to get them merged.

## Why is this in Rust?

Because I wanted to learn Rust.
