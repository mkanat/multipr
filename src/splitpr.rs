Originally I was using the patch crate to parse patches, but it does both
less and more than I need. I don't need to understand hunks (which patch
does) but I do want to, ideally, preserve all the header content of each
patch (which patch does not).

This does not borrow the input string, because in all callers we never
need to re-use the string again.
